# Web-Dev-Course-2024
🚀 Excited to embark on my web development journey once again, starting from the basics and aiming for mastery! 🌟

Having already delved into HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Tailwind CSS, Bootstrap, and dipped my toes into React, I'm now revisiting these technologies to solidify my command over them. 📚💻

Once I've honed my skills on the frontend, I'll be diving headfirst into backend development using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. 🛠️🌐

Ready to turn my passion for web development into tangible projects and build a robust skill set!
